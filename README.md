# ROS 2 Foxy Installation Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step process for installing ROS 2 Foxy on an Ubuntu system. By following these instructions, you will set up ROS 2 Foxy, enabling you to work on various robotics projects.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the necessary requirements and has Ubuntu installed. ROS 2 Foxy is compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa).

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Set Locale

To ensure that your system is set up with the correct locale, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### Step 2: Add the ROS 2 Apt Repository

Add the ROS 2 repository to your system's software sources:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'
```

### Step 3: Update Package Index

Update the package index to include the ROS 2 packages:

```sh
sudo apt update
```

### Step 4: Install ROS 2 Foxy

Install the ROS 2 Foxy desktop version:

```sh
sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop
```

### Step 5: Environment Setup

To automatically source the ROS 2 environment setup script when you open a terminal, add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:

```sh
echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 6: Install Dependencies for Building Packages

Install additional dependencies for building and running ROS 2 packages:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete
```

## Verification

To verify your installation, you can run a simple demo node. Open a new terminal and execute:

```sh
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see messages being published by the demo node.

## Additional Notes

Make sure to source the ROS 2 Foxy setup script before running ROS 2 commands. This can be done by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file, which ensures the setup script is sourced automatically when you open a terminal:

```sh
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```


This guide will help you get started with ROS 2 Foxy on your system.
